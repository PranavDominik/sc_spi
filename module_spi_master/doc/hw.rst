Evaluation platforms
====================

Recommended hardware
--------------------

sliceKIT
++++++++

This module may be evaluated using the sliceKIT Modular Development Platform. Required board SKUs are:

   * XP-SKC-L16 (sliceKIT L16 Core Board) plus XA-SK-XTAG2 (sliceKIT xTAG adaptor) 

No sliceCARDS will be required since the example application uses the flash memory on the core board.

The demo application can also be run on the xCORE Simulator, without requiring a hardware development kit.

XK-1A
+++++

The same application can also run on the XK-1A development board.
